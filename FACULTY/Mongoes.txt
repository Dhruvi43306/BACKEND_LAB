what is mongooes?
-->mongooes is an object Data Modelling(ODM) library for MongoDB desined for use
    in node.js application.it provides a Sechma-based solution to model your application
    data and simplifies intrections with the mongoDB database.


Mongoose vs. MongoDB
-->MONGODB is the actual NoSQL database system that stores data in flexible,JSON-like documents.
-->MONGOOSE is a tool that runs on top of the native Monogodb node.js driver.
   it adds a layer of structure,validation,and abstraction to help developer manage data
   consistency and relationship more easily.


->without Mongooes
    db.users.insertOne({name:"Dhruvi,age:"twenty"})
--Age should be number, but Monogodb allows it.

-->With Mongooes    
const userSechma = new Monogoes.Sechma{{
    name:String
    age:Number
}}
